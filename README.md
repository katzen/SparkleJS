# SparkleJS
Particle effects for DOM elements

View the demo at: http://tablekat.net/phys/sparklejs/demo/

Very early work in progress!

TODO
----
- colors? Blending!
- rotation velocity and spread
- rotation and spread
- scale and spread
- creation rate!?
- allow position spread to be over an element's size... maybe just figure that manually in the emitter when making a particleSystem!
- get proper z-index for new particles!!! Option for particles to be above or below that.
- particle fade out?
